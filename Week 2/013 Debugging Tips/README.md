# Debugging Tips

## What is debugging?
Debugging is the process of identifying, analyzing, and resolving bugs or defects in software or systems. Bugs are errors or flaws that cause a program to produce incorrect or unexpected results, or to behave in unintended ways. Debugging aims to ensure that software functions correctly and meets specified requirements.

## Tips to help you debug your programs faster and more efficiently
1. Describe the problem
2. Reproduce the bug
3. Try to think from the perspective of the computer running the program
4. Fix all visible errors (even if the final result obtained is not the expected result)
5. Use statements like print() or return after every vulnerable step so that you ensure that everything is working the way it should
6. Use a debugging tool
7. Take a break so that you avoid burnout
8. Ask a friend/community member to help
